# TIME_SERIES_FORECASTING
 This Repository looks at various Time Series Forecasting Methods and Techniques to predict the future! We look at both the Basic and ARIMA Modeling Techniques.
 This script is primarily done in Python, Open Source Software, but can be replicated in nearly any Business Intelligence Tool.
 ARIMA Modeling is a form of Regression, and more closely aligned to Machine Learning Algorithms.
 Below are some Websites to learn more. I was taught Time Series Forecastng in the Master of Science Data Science & Analytics program at Elmhurst University.
 The great thing about this is that it is directly connected to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, public data API and automated on the latest CPI and PPI data!
 This script can be replicated or modified to any SeriesID in the BLS public API.
